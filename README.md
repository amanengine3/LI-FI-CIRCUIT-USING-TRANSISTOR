# LI-FI-CIRCUIT-USING-TRANSISTOR
My  project is a transistor based analog audio Li-Fi circuit which can stream good quality music from our phone/mp3 player to speakers at home. 
# Introduction
Li-Fi stands for Light Fidelity, which uses visible light as medium for data transmission. The Li-Fi system consists of normal LED light bulbs and modulating circuits. The idea of Li-Fi is to use existing light infrastructure to transmit data to our computer, Smartphones, tablets etc. This will eliminate some of the main limitations and disadvantages of traditional radio communication, such as the Wi-Fi system that we use at home or office. Li-Fi utilizes LED light bulbs which are connected to a modulating circuit which will convert incoming data streams into rapidly flashing light. We human beings canâ€™t perceive the high frequency flashing light but we will perceive a steady room lighting without any flicker. The receiver circuit can capture the high frequency flashing of LED and decodes it into understandable data streams for our computer or smartphone.
#Applications of Li-Fi
1. Li-Fi and Live Streaming
2. Li-Fi technology in Hospitals
3. Li-Fi in the Workplace
4. Li-Fi in Schools
5. Li-Fi in Retail
